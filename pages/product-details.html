          The Retro Mesh Football Jersey – Red channels iconic sportswear vibes into a bold everyday
          statement. Designed with breathable mesh and saturated color, it brings energy, edge, and
          nostalgia to any outfit. This piece blends athletic function with a casual streetwear
          twist. The deep red base with contrasting stripes and block-style detailing draws from
          vintage team uniforms, delivering instant character. It's lightweight and easy to wear,
          especially in warm climates or layered over long sleeves in cooler seasons. Made from
          open-knit polyester mesh, the fabric allows air to flow freely, making it ideal for
          festivals, game days, or high-heat afternoons. It feels feather-light against the skin and
          dries quickly, so you stay fresh and comfortable. A relaxed, drop-shoulder fit gives it a
          slouchy, laid-back shape, while reinforced seams along the shoulders and collar ensure
          durability over time. The v-neck collar adds authenticity while also keeping the neckline
          airy and modern. Minimal branding lets the jersey's silhouette and color do the talking.
          It’s a piece that shines solo but also layers beautifully over basics. Throw it on with
          cargo pants, sweat shorts, or even wide-leg denim for a full retro-sporty look. Despite
          its nostalgic inspiration, the design is surprisingly versatile. Whether you’re going for
          early 2000s hip-hop energy or minimalist colorblocking, this jersey slides effortlessly
          into your style rotation. The Retro Mesh Football Jersey – Red is all about movement—both
          physical and stylistic. It invites boldness, comfort, and a bit of that game-day swagger,
          anytime and anywhere.

            anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the
            right to vary any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by the
            Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has
            been placed and accepted by Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to
            cancel or vary the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.

              prices are provided for indicative purposes only and there is no obligation for Shop

              reason to acquire the quantity of Products sold then without limiting Shop's other
              rights and remedies the unit price charged for the goods sold may be amended to take

              Credit Card Payments may attract a surcharge, and Shop will inform the Customer if
              this is to be the case before processing the transaction. Unless otherwise agreed in
              writing by Shop, where Shop has not agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to
              the Customer, the total purchase price for Products supplied will be due for payment
              in cash prior to delivery.
              <br /><br />
              Where Shop has agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer, the
              Customer must make payments in accordance with the payment terms provided by Shop.
              <br /><br />
              Where Shop has approved the provision of a commercial credit arrangement with the
              Customer but has not provided notice of the payment terms to the Customer, the
              Customer must pay the total purchase price for Products supplied within seven days of
              the statement date.
              <br /><br />
              Credit Card Payment at an Invoice or transaction level may also be offered to the
              Customer as a stand-alone payment method, or in conjunction with Credit Card Direct

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-black/60">
              Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the
              representations made by the Customer. In the event that there is a change in ownership
              of the Customer, whether total or partial, the Customer must immediately provide
              written notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. Until Shop receives written
              notice from the Customer of a change in ownership, the Customer (including where it is
              a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds Shop indemnified against
              any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs, charges, fees and
              expenses incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company or entity
              which may have purchased the Customer's business or shares and used the previously
              approved account for trading.
              <br /><br />
              Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card
              Direct Debit, the Customer must provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior
              to any change in ownership of the business to allow Shop sufficient time to contact
              the new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card information if applicable.

              All descriptive specifications, illustrations, drawings, data, dimensions and weights

              are approximate only and are intended to be merely a general description of the goods.

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-black/60">
              The means of delivering the Products to the Customer will be at Shop's discretion.
              Shop reserves the right to deliver Products in part deliveries. If Shop incurs
              additional costs for meeting special or urgent delivery arrangements (e.g., Tasmania /
              Northern Territory Deliveries), these may be charged to the Customer and may include
              airfreight. The Customer agrees to accept delivery of the Products sold at any time
              during normal business hours.
              <br /><br />
              Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any late delivery of the
              Products and late delivery will not entitle the Customer to rescind or repudiate the
              Customer's order for the Products.
