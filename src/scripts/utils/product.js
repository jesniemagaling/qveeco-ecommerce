    details: `The Vintage Knit Sweater – Multi is a bold nod to retro colorblocking and expressive cold-weather style. With its rich mix of colors and patterns, this sweater feels like something pulled from a 90s photo album, yet its modern cut and soft feel make it a standout for today's fashion.

    Crafted from a midweight acrylic-blend yarn, the sweater offers cozy warmth without feeling too bulky. It's soft against the skin, with just enough stretch to ensure all-day comfort. The vibrant color combinations and intricate knit patterns create a textured surface that catches the eye.

    Its slightly oversized fit offers a relaxed silhouette that’s perfect for layering over collared shirts or under winter coats. Dropped shoulders and ribbed cuffs give it that casual, slouchy drape, while the crew neckline keeps the look grounded.

    Every sweater has a slightly unique layout due to the knitting process, giving each piece a one-of-a-kind character. The multi-color palette blends earthy neutrals with bold accents, allowing it to pair surprisingly well with both muted and vibrant outfits.

    The hem is designed to fall just below the waistline, making it easy to style with jeans, cargos, or corduroys. You can also go full retro and tuck it into tailored trousers with loafers for a vintage-chic statement.

    Perfect for brisk fall days, cozy coffee shop mornings, or holiday gatherings, this sweater brings comfort and style in equal measure. Despite its throwback inspiration, its quality and colorway keep it feeling fresh.

    The Vintage Knit Sweater – Multi proves that knitwear doesn’t have to be boring. It brings warmth, personality, and just the right amount of eccentricity to your wardrobe—ideal for anyone looking to stand out in the cold.`,
